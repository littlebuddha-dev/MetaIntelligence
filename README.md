# CogniQuantum: Advanced Reasoning System for Large Language Models

## Breaking Through "The Illusion of Thinking" - A Research-Based Implementation

**CogniQuantum** is a revolutionary LLM interface that implements solutions to overcome the fundamental limitations identified in Apple Research's groundbreaking paper ["The Illusion of Thinking"](https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf). This updated version introduces powerful new features including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), quantum-inspired reasoning, and self-improving complexity analysis.

## 🛠️ Installation & Quick Start

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.10+
- Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- At least one LLM provider API key or a local Ollama setup

### **Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/littlebuddha-dev/Cogni-Quantum.git
cd Cogni-Quantum

# Install all required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create and configure your environment file
cp .env.example .env

python fetch_llm_v2.py claude "Design a sustainable urban transportation system." --mode decomposed

# Adaptive mode for unknown complexity
python fetch_llm_v2.py openai "Analyze the economic impact of AI on the job market." --mode adaptive

# Quantum-inspired synthesis for deep insights
python fetch_llm_v2.py openai "What is the nature of consciousness?" --mode quantum_inspired

# Speculative thought for diverse initial ideas
python fetch_llm_v2.py ollama "Generate three innovative business ideas for a remote work future." --mode speculative_thought

# RAG-powered query using Wikipedia
python fetch_llm_v2.py openai "What were the key findings of the LIGO experiment?" --mode balanced --wikipedia
```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### **Academic Research with RAG**

```bash
# Augment a query with the latest information from Wikipedia
python fetch_llm_v2.py claude \
"Based on recent findings, what are the main challenges in quantum computing?" \
--mode balanced --wikipedia
```

### **Business Strategy Synthesis**

```bash
# Use quantum-inspired mode to generate a multi-faceted strategy
python fetch_llm_v2.py openai \
"Develop a holistic market entry strategy for an AI startup in Europe, considering optimistic, pessimistic, and ethical viewpoints." \
--mode quantum_inspired
```

### **Technical Problem Solving**

```bash
# Design a complex system using the decomposition strategy
python fetch_llm_v2.py ollama \
"Design a high-availability, scalable microservices architecture for a social media app." \
--mode decomposed --model deepseek-r1
```

## 🔬 Architecture & Implementation

The V2 architecture integrates new components for RAG, self-learning, and advanced reasoning pipelines.

### **Core Components**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[fetch_llm_v2.py] --> B[CLI Handler]
    B --> C[CogniQuantumSystemV2]
    
    subgraph CogniQuantumSystemV2
        D[ComplexityAnalyzer] -- reads --> E[ComplexityLearner]
        F[EnhancedReasoningEngine]
        G[QuantumReasoningEngine]
        H[RAGManager]
    end

    C -- orchestrates --> F
    C -- orchestrates --> G
    C -- orchestrates --> H
    F -- executes --> I[Provider API]
    G -- executes --> I
    H -- augments prompt for --> C

    E -- saves/loads --> J[learnings.json]
    H -- retrieves from --> K[Wikipedia/Files]
```

### **Research Implementation Pipeline**

1. **Input**: User prompt is received
2. **RAG (Optional)**: RAGManager extracts a search query, retrieves context from Wikipedia or local files, and augments the prompt
3. **Complexity Analysis**: AdaptiveComplexityAnalyzer assesses the complexity, potentially using suggestions from the ComplexityLearner
4. **Pipeline Selection**: The system chooses a reasoning pipeline (EnhancedReasoningEngine, QuantumReasoningEngine, Parallel) based on the selected mode
5. **Execution**: The chosen engine processes the prompt, applying regime-specific strategies (e.g., decomposition, overthinking prevention)
6. **Self-Correction (Adaptive Mode)**: The system can re-evaluate an insufficient solution and escalate the complexity regime for another attempt
7. **Learning**: If the complexity was adjusted, ComplexityLearner records the successful outcome to improve future analyses
8. **Output**: A final, structured solution with a detailed thought process is returned

async def run():
    # Get an enhanced provider
    provider = get_provider('openai', enhanced=True)
    
    # The provider's enhanced_call uses the CogniQuantumSystemV2 internally
    result = await provider.call(
        "Design a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for financial modeling.",
        mode='decomposed'  # Use a V2 mode
    )

    if not result.get('error'):
        print("Final Solution:\n", result['text'])
